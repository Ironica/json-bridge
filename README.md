**A small project for testing playground data structure and exposing the possibility to incorporate its structure in C# environment**

- Using playground data structure as per the archived version of *Amatsukaze* repo. (current 1.0.1-pre).
- Only tested with ColorfulTile structure.
- No error handling regarding the response status

Finished in an after noon so there are certainly lots of bugs. However it's just for purpose of demo.

Use this to understand how the data structure corresponding to Playground of back-end side is built.

In the near future I might update the project to reflect changes in new version of back-end.
